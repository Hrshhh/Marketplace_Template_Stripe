TEMPLATE FOR MARKETPLACE WEBSITES USING STRIPE.

Basic Template of Marketplace Websites created using Stripe payment gateway, using Stripe onboarding Link.
One Can create various Marketplace websites following this template

Built front-end using React and Redux and styled it with Bootstrap, ANT Design.
Created a REST API using EXPRESSJS and MONGODB for the back-end, to handle the routes, database interactions and STRIPE INTEGRATION.

Implemented using Stripe Onboarding link (in STANDARD type of account,as EXPRESS account is NOT SUPPORTED in INDIA) for vendors to connect their Stripe account to the marketplace.

Implementing security measures such as encrypting user passwords using Bcrypt and generating JSON WEB TOKENS (JWT) for authentication and authorization.
Setting up server-side validation and handling errors, showing problems on UI with the help of TOASTIFY package.
Implemented Login and registration page with stripe integration.

This process requires a strong understanding of each technology and their integration, as well as knowledge of RESTful API design, stripe integration and best practices such as password encryption and token-based authentication.
Additionally, the client and server side should be separated, and the front-end should interact with the back-end via the API routes.
